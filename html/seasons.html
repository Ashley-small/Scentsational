<h1>Seasons</h1>

<div class="seasons">
  <p>You know how you would usually wear a hoodie or a sweater in the autumn and winter months and then lock those clothes away for the summer and wearing your plain with tees and shirts, you need to think of your aftershave collection in the same way or you will experience a lot of problems when you wear them. Typically there are two main genres for fragrances.That being the fresh and clean fragrances and the more overpowering fragrances with monster projection. These are often broken down into smaller subgenres, for example some of the fresh fragrances smells like the ocean or the sea and as a result is referred to as aquatic fragrances. Some other fresh fragrances have a wood base and are referred to as woody fragrances. In the overpowering scents, the two main sub-genres are oriental fragrances and gourmand fragrances. The oriental fragrances smell very spicy and warm like cinnamon and pink pepper, while the gourmand fragrances smell very tasty like dark chocolate or coffee. The main point is that there are a variety of different scents and some of the accords work better in different seasons and temperatures meaning that it is best to adjust your fragrance choices based on the season.</p>

  <h2>Autumn</h2>
  <p>Autumn is a beautiful season. It comes with cooler temperatures, the opportunity to rest from the travelling and partying that took place during the summer, and of course halloween. However, Autumn brings a major fragrance issue. It is not hot enough to wear a completely fresh fragrance so the performance and projection will not be good. It also isn't cold enough to wear an overly powerful projection monster as the heat would make it make it even more powerful. The solution is that you find a combination of fresh but powerful scent and my recommendation for this is <span>Azzaro Wanted By Night</span>. It has the notes of cinnamon, mandarin orange and tobacco that gives it the neccessary power but it also has lavender and vanilla for additional freshness.</p>
  <a class="amazon" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Azzaro-Eau-Toilette-Women-100/dp/B07BX5PGKT/ref=sr_1_3?crid=28EHXE8H2GXN5&dchild=1&keywords=azzaro+wanted+by+night&qid=1634132223&qsid=258-5292810-7533365&sprefix=azzaro%2Caps%2C199&sr=8-3&sres=B07BX5PGKT%2CB07N5HMVWJ%2CB0851PSJZ7%2CB07HVMG4MG%2CB07BX3DFVK%2CB07S7RKZ2S%2CB003JSEG4Q%2CB078P7YZ3L%2CB00733QVBE%2CB0086WK4XC%2CB01N5DO2HQ%2CB01FDXG9XU%2CB07S9P97QX%2CB01H58J0G4%2CB012NOWNZ0%2CB07JPJSHBH%2CB074V5C4VT%2CB00OVLTEZG%2CB002XITZ1C%2CB002XQ1TSG&srpt=PERSONAL_FRAGRANCE"target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><i class="fa fa-amazon fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

  <h2>Winter</h2>
  <p>Winter is season with by far the coldest months of the year and typically the season where fragrance is less of an issue. The only rule is that you do not wear the same fragrances that you would wear in summer. The fresh and clean fragrances will not have the desired affect in winter due to the cold temperatures and that expensive bottle of Creed Viking Cologne will not project like you wish. Really and truly, you would like a stronger fragrance that is either a gourmand, meaning that it smells tasty like tiramisu or a spicy fragrance. My suggestion is simple.<span> Spicebomb Extreme</span> . It literally smells like Christmas</p>
  <a class="amazon"href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Viktor-Rolf-Spicebomb-Extreme-Parfum/dp/B00WYP5J4Q/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1DC56DUMDHM1R&dchild=1&keywords=spicebomb+extreme&qid=1634133127&qsid=258-5292810-7533365&sprefix=spicebomb+e%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-3&sres=B00WYP5ZHW%2CB00WYP5J4Q%2CB09G77PG54%2CB075PPQ6C1%2CB074L4T33K%2CB07K196HGH%2CB00TUI8ZMI%2CB012NCAQFG%2CB08BYY31MR%2CB0854F5DKN%2CB072PZCK57%2CB00F992MV2%2CB00CP7A1BY%2CB07PQLTV8D%2CB00LVJ09QY%2CB08825TKYX%2CB07PPHGS62%2CB01GD2H31W%2CB00OVLTEZG%2CB09G8B18NJ&srpt=PERSONAL_FRAGRANCE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <i class="fa fa-amazon fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

  <h2>Spring</h2>
  <p>Spring is when everything is in bloom. Similar to Autumn, you really do not want to be wearing a very overpowering scent. You want the scent to be noticeable but not overly heavy. They should be more woody or aquatic, meaning that it is like being next to the ocean, or it should contain some sort of citrus. The suggestion I have for a Spring fragrance is <span>Prada L'homme</span>. This is a very woody and fresh fragrance, containing iris, violet and amber but also sandalwood for that woody feel. This is a sensational fresh fragrance that also doubles as an exceptional office/school fragrance.</p>

      <h2>Summer</h2>
      <p>Summer is my favourite time of the year but also the motivation behind this page. Remember my anecdote on the about page of me purchasing Spicebomb and Stronger With You. Those are both sweet, high projecting fragrances that ultimately become even more potent in extreme heat. I was at a party and I was wearing Spicebomb on a fairly hot day and it was like the aftershave was mutating. It was not a pleasant experience and I suggest you don't do that. Go for something more fresh and enjoy all of the parties. My suggestion for a summer fragrance is <span>John Varvatos' Artisan Pure</span>. Fairly inexpensive citrus based fragrance with little risk of choking out people walking past you in the summer.</p>
