        early Spring months as it didn't overpower everyone, however, by April I had noticed that I had made a big mistake. I will explain more about this mistake on the page titled <a href="seasons.html"> Seasons </a>. The aim for me will be to
        educate you on the mistakes that I made in the 2+ years that I have been involved in fragrance. It will also document future mistakes that I will eventually make as I continue to learn about scents. It will act as a guide for men who are just
