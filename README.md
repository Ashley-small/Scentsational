This is my fragrance passion project that essentially acts like a guide for men who are becoming interested in exploring fragrance. This explains some things that I never realised had an effect on the power of a fragrance such as temperatures and actual occasions where you where these fragrances. 


I am planning on eventually recreating this with a react build and incorporate a few things on the back-end including a fragrance api that would ultimately allow users to search for specific fragrances. I also would add Mailchimp API functionally for email updates.
